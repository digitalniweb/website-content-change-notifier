<h1>Claimer</h1>
This is personal project to watch for changes on websites by scraping their content periodically and getting notified if changes in specified html element occur.

That said I am not optimizing this app in any way. It is meant for my personal use.

**I am not responsible for any problems caused by using this app.**

<h2>Usage</h2>

Using node 24+ with types striping

-   "node app/app.ts" - main script to be executed - starts the checking, don't close terminal.
-   "node app/addSite.ts" - change this file and execute it to add a site to check
